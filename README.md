## SimCell

**SimCell** is a JavaScript-based evolution simulator where autonomous entities (“cells”) adapt and evolve to survive within a procedurally generated world. Through natural selection and optimization, species compete for resources in an animated genetic algorithm influenced by environmental conditions and observer input.

The simulation can produce emergent scenarios such as overpopulation, famine, extinction events, territorial domination, and unexpected evolutionary outcomes — making each run unique.
